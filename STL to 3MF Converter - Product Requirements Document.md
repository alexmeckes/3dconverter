# **STL to 3MF Converter \- Product Requirements Document**

### **Product Overview**

Web-based tool to convert STL (stereolithography) files to 3MF (3D Manufacturing Format) format, making 3D models more compatible with modern 3D printing workflows.

### **User Problems Solved**

* STL files lack material, color, and metadata support  
* Converting between formats requires desktop software  
* STL files are inefficient for complex geometries  
* Existing tools require installation or licenses

### **Target Users**

* 3D printing enthusiasts  
* Professional designers  
* Manufacturing engineers  
* Online 3D printing services

### **Core Features (MVP)**

1. File Upload  
   * Drag-and-drop interface  
   * Support for binary STL files  
   * File size limit: 50MB  
2. Conversion Engine  
   * Parse STL vertex/triangle data  
   * Generate valid 3MF XML structure  
   * Preserve model geometry  
   * Basic error handling  
3. File Download  
   * Automatic download trigger  
   * Original filename preservation  
   * Proper MIME type

### **Technical Requirements**

* Browser-based implementation  
* No server-side processing  
* Support latest Chrome/Firefox/Safari  
* Follow 3MF Core Specification v1.3.0

### **Success Metrics**

* Successful conversion rate \> 95%  
* Average conversion time \< 3s for 10MB files  
* Zero geometry loss during conversion  
* Valid 3MF output validated against schema

### **Future Enhancements**

* ASCII STL support  
* Material/color preservation  
* Batch conversion  
* Cloud processing for large files  
* Model preview  
* Compression options
